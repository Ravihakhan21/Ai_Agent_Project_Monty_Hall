# Ai_Agent_Project_Monty_Hall
This Python project simulates the famous Monty Hall Problem, but with a twist â€” it introduces an AI-powered strategy decision layer and a random guest agent that adds realism and interactivity. The simulation evaluates both switching and non-switching strategies and determines how smart decision-making affects winning chances.
