#  Monty Hall Game AI Agent Simulator

This project simulates the famous **Monty Hall Problem** using Python and adds an intelligent twist by introducing a **strategy-aware AI agent**. The simulation compares the effectiveness of two strategies: **switching** and **not switching**. A randomly selected guest plays the game, and the outcome is analyzed with both statistics and visuals.

##  What is the Monty Hall Problem?

The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario:

1. A player is shown **3 doors**.
2. Behind one door is a **car** (the prize), and behind the other two are **goats**.
3. The player selects one door.
4. The host (Monty) opens one of the other two doors, always revealing a goat.
5. The player is given a choice: **stick** with the original door or **switch** to the remaining unopened door.

Mathematically, **switching gives a ~66.7% chance to win**, while sticking with the original door gives only ~33.3%.
